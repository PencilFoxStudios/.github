## Hi there 👋🦊✏️

Hey there! We're Pencil Fox Studios, a small group of freelance software developers who just wanted to have some fun with creating cool things! If you've seen our work, you would know that one project we put our name on is never the same as another. We basically tackle the issues that no big Silicon Valley tech mogul bothered to bring up at their boring board meetings. We are proud of our ability to think outside the box, and put together software solutions that nobody has ever seen attempted before.

This is our github organization. You may or many not see some open-sourced projects of ours here in the future! Stay tuned!
